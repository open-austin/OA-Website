<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/30.3083/-97.6300">OpenStreetMap</a> is a is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Users have the ability to add and edit features in the maps.</p>
<p>The City of Austin publishes copious geospatial data sets, including street address and footprints of all buildings in the city and surrounding areas. A group of volunteers is working to get this information imported into OpenStreetMap, so that it has accurate information and addresses for our city.</p>
<p>Andy Wilson will talk about the OpenStreetMap project and the effort to add City of Austin data to the map.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
