<p><strong>Date:</strong> Mon, Jun 15, 2015<br />
<strong>Time:</strong> 6:45 – 8:45 pm<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Terrazas Branch Library, 1105 E. Cesar Chavez St, Austin, TX, 78702 (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/pgvzuw4">map</a>)<br />
<strong>Calendar:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=aHBuazlwN2FlNGFodTFyYmxsMWVzOTlhdmcgb3BlbmF1c3RpbkBt&amp;ctz=America/Chicago&amp;ctz=America/Chicago">link</a></p>
<p><strong>Invited Guest:</strong> Miles Hutson<br />
<strong>Topic:</strong> Developing a Crime API</p>
<p>Miles Hutson wanted to do analysis of crime information around the city. Although APD does post crime information on the open government data portal, it didn't have all that he needed. Miles will discuss how he found the data he needed, scraped it from the web, and produced a new API for his analysis. He'll share the results of his work and his analysis.</p>
<p>Also: ATX Hack for Change 2015 is one for the books. We'll have an update on the event. We'd also like to invite any participants to come and briefly present their projects, and talk about their plans (and needs) to move it forward.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.  The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking.</p>
