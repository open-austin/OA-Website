<p><strong>Invited Guest:</strong> Sharla Chamberlain, City of Austin, <a href="http://austintexas.gov/digitalinclusion">Telecommunications and Regulatory Affairs</a><br />
<strong>Topic:</strong> Data to Drive Digital Innovation</p>
<p>The City of Austin envisions a community in which every Austin resident has access to the resources and knowledge needed to fully participate in our increasingly digital society. We are working to build a transparent and data-driven informational portal to visualize available resources, identify unmet needs, get information about digital opportunities directly to residents, and learn more about the barriers residents face to access and literacy. Tools and services like website design, interactive mapping, spatial and statistical analysis, database management, graphics, and user interface enhancement will be key to building this portal.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
