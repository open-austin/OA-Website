<p>The City of Austin has enacted an open government policy, and the City Manager has issued an open data directive. Late last year, the City Manager created a high-level board to execute on an open data program.</p>
<p>Kerry O'Connor, the city's Chief Innovation Officer, participates on that board. She will give an update on the city's open data initiatives, and discuss plans for the coming months.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
