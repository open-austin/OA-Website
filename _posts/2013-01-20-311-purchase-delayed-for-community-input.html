<p>On Thursday, January 17, the Austin City Council was poised to approve a $724K contract for 311 services. It was item 37 on the agenda and you can view it <a href="https://austin.siretechnologies.com/sirepub/mtgviewer.aspx?meetid=349&amp;doctype=agenda&amp;itemid=20969">here</a>. (The <a href="https://austin.siretechnologies.com/sirepub/view.aspx?cabinet=published_meetings&amp;fileid=408543">purchasing doc</a> attachment has summary information on the project.)</p>
<p>Open Austin member Chip Rosenthal spoke at the City Council meeting and asked, on behalf of Open Austin, to delay action and allow the local civic tech community to get a presentation and provide feedback on the proposal. With the support of Joe Calabrese, Program Director for Austin 311, City Council approved our request on a 6-0 vote.</p>
<p>You can view video playback from that portion of the meeting <a href="http://austintx.swagit.com/play/01172013-527/#9">here</a>.</p>
<p>First thing you should know is that there has been some crummy press reporting on this item. Some news reports have presented this as a $724K purchase for a mobile app. Actually, the mobile app is just one line item in the project.</p>
<p>Still, even though the mobile app is just a part of the project, it's still a lot of money. We'd like to make sure it's funds well spent. We'd also like, when feasible and prudent, to support spending technology dollars locally.</p>
<p>It is important that this project improve access to 311 data and services. The City of Austin uses a proprietary product for the 311 call center. The Austin 311 database and programming interfaces (APIs) currently are closed to the public. Nationally, there is a movement towards <a href="http://open311.org/">open standards</a> and <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Software">applications</a> to support 311 services. We believe it is important that our 311 investments help us leverage the emerging open tools and standards.</p>
<p>The City Council has requested that Austin Energy give a presentation to the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/cttc">Community Technology and Telecommunications Commission</a> on Wednesday evening, February 13. (Calendar link is <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=aWd2c20xNjRjaXZiaDNpdHFvZWFhZHZ1NG8gb3BlbmF1c3RpbkBt&amp;ctz=America/Chicago">here</a>.) The meeting is open to the public, and usually presented live on <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/channel-6">Channel 6</a> cablecast and internet stream. Citizens are welcome to attend, and may sign up to speak up to three minutes.</p>
<p>Please come participate in the commission meeting to learn more about -- and to support opening -- 311 services.</p>
