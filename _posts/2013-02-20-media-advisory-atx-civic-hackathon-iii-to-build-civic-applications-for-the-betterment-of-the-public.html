For immediate release</p>
<p><strong>ATX Civic Hackathon III to build civic applications for the betterment of the public</strong></p>
<p>Local tech developers, designers, data experts and hackers will come together for an all-day event on Saturday, Feb. 23, at Conjunctured Coworking, 1309 E 7th St, Austin, TX 78702, to build new apps with a civic purpose and that benefit of the community.</p>
<p>Organizers are looking for people with software design, data analysis and other skills in the technology industry to volunteer and participate in this free event. Registration information is available at: <a href="http://www.open-austin.org/article/137">http://www.open-austin.org/article/137</a>.</p>
<p>Projects proposed for the event include building a website to reunite lost pets with their owners, a searchable database of campaign finance records and a mobile app that knows your garbage and recycling pickup schedule.</p>
<p>The ATX Civic Hackathon III kicks off at 9:30 a.m. with "pitches" for new project ideas. Then, the hackers break into groups, to work on their selected projects. At the end of the day, the hackers assemble to present their work.</p>
<p>“Civic hackathons are a natural fit for Austin. This is where tech innovation meets civic action," said Austin City Council Member Laura Morrison. "I have no doubt that this year's outcomes will surpass even the exciting results from the past. This partnership between the community and the city provides a unique opportunity for Austin."</p>
<p>This year’s ATX Civic Hackathon III is hosted by Open Austin (<a href="http://www.open-austin.org/">http://www.open-austin.org/)</a>. Open Austin is a local volunteer group that advocates for open government, open data, and civic applications.</p>
<p>ATX Civic Hackathon is affiliated with Code for America (<a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/">www.codeforamerica.org</a>). Code for America is a nonprofit organization that partners with cities nationwide to promote innovative and effective use of technology to better communities. In 2012, the City of Austin was selected as one of eight U.S. cities to participate in the Code for America program. Last year, two civic hackathons were held in Austin in conjunction with Code for America.</p>
