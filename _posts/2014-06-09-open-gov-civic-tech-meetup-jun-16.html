<p><strong>Topic:</strong> After Hack: ATX Hack for Change<br />
<strong>Invited Guests:</strong> Claire Dunn, Keith Casey</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">The second annual </span><a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://atxhackforchange.org/">ATX Hack for Change</a><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> was a great success. Over 150 people hacked for 20 hours, and presented 16 projects at the end of the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">At our monthly meetup, we'll discuss the outcomes of the hackathon, and how the community can "hack it forward" for the projects that emerged. Our invited guests are D. Keith Casey, Jr. (<a href="http://www.op3nvoice.com/">OP3Nvoice</a>), the event emcee and national hackathon expert, and Claire Dunn (St. Edward's University), the manager for the event.</span></p>
<p>We invite project champions to come to the meetup. We'll provide an opportunity to present your project, and talk with participants about how it can be advanced.</p>
<p>If you participated in the hackathon, come provide your feedback. If you weren't able to attend, this is your opportunity to connect with the projects, and get involved with future hack efforts.</p>
<p>After the meetup, we'll move across the street to <a href="http://cenoteaustin.com/">Cenote</a> cafe.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking. If you park, however, be sure to move your car if you plan to come to Cenote. The lot is locked when the library closes.</p>
<p>The Open Austin Hack Team will have a check-in from 6:00 - 6:30 pm, in advance of the meetup. If you are a developer or designer who wants to work on hacking projects, please come for the check-in to find out what's going on.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
