<p>Our latest deployment is a <a href="https://twitter.com/CutePetsAustin"><img class="alignright wp-image-965 size-medium" src="/assets/CutePetsAustin-241x300.png" alt="CutePetsAustin Twitter feed" width="241" height="300" /></a>Twitterbot called <a href="https://twitter.com/CutePetsAustin">Cute Pets Austin.</a></p>
<p>Every fews hours, it locates a pet that's a recent <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/animal-services">Austin Animal Center</a> intake, and posts a tweet with information on that animal.</p>
<p>Our Twitterbot is part of a national network of <a href="https://twitter.com/drewSaysGoVeg/lists/cutepetseverywhere">Cute Pets Everywhere</a> bots, which started in <a href="https://twitter.com/CutePetsDenver">Denver</a>. The Denver project was implemented by Code for America fellows and community volunteers. You can read more about the Denver project here:  <a href="http://www.govtech.com/data/What-Open-Data-Can-is-Doing-for-Pets.html">What Open Data is Doing for Denver Dogs</a></p>
<p>The Austin implementation is a "fork" of the Denver code, rewritten in Python by Open Austin member <a href="https://twitter.com/luqmonster">Luqmaan Dawoodjee</a>. It's been <a href="https://github.com/open-austin/CutePetsAustin">published as open source</a>.</p>
<p>Open Austin has been working with the Animal Services staff on open data issues. We hope that more information -- and community produced tools -- will be available soon.</p>
