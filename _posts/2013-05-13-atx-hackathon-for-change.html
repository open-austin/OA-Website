<p>Join the City of Austin and Hack for Change in the ATX Hackathon for Change 2013, a National Day of Civic Hacking event deep in the heart of Texas. Let's get Austin's finest data junkies, coders, developers, designers, and general hack-enthusiasts together on the St. Edward's University campus June 1 &amp; 2 to discuss and develop civic solutions.</p>
<p>We'll be working with City of Austin data sets to address the Austin-area issues you're most passionate about. Come prepared to hack your way through a project addressing anything from mass transit scheduling and communication to matching up entrepreneurs and skilled resources in the area. Take advantage of this chance to put your priorities in action and connect with like-minded local hackers to make something uniquely ATX.</p>
