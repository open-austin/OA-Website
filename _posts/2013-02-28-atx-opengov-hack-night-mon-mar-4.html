<p>On Monday evening, March 4, Open Austin will be conducting another ATX OpenGov Hack Night.</p>
<p>OpenGov Hack Night is for developers and designers to meet and work on projects in support of civic applications and open data. You can bring a project to work on, get help with a project you are working on, solicit volunteers to help you with a project you are working on, or just be there to help.</p>
<p>This will be an opportunity to continue projects started at the recent <a href="http://www.open-austin.org/article/292">ATX Civic Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Space is limited.</strong> If you wish to attend, please RSVP as soon as possible. Pizza and drinks will be provided for those who RSVP.</p>
<p>RSVP here: <a href="https://openaustin.ticketbud.com/hack-night-20130304">https://openaustin.ticketbud.com/hack-night-20130304</a></p>
<p><strong>Please be on time.</strong> Doors will be open 6:45 - 7:00. At 7:00 we close the doors and begin hacking. If you need to be let in after that time please call or text Chip Rosenthal at 512-573-5174.</p>
