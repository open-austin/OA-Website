<strong>Invited Guest:</strong> City of Austin Council Member <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/place-4/biography">Laura Morrison</a><br />
<strong>Topic:</strong> City of Austin Open Government Initiative
</div>
<p>Council Member Laura Morrison is a member of the Austin City Council and chairs the council's committee on Emerging Technology and Telecommunications. She has sponsored the open government resolutions adopted by the City Council, as well as the budget amendment that led to the hiring of a Chief Innovation Officer for the city.</p>
<p>We've invited her to come speak about the current status of the open government initiative, and some of the challenges that lay ahead for these programs.</p>
<p>After the meetup, we'll move across the street to <a href="http://cenoteaustin.com/">Cenote</a> cafe.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking. If you park, however, be sure to move your car if you plan to come to Cenote. The lot is locked when the library closes.</p>
<p>The Open Austin Hack Team will have a check-in from 6:00 - 6:30 pm, in advance of the meetup. If you are a developer or designer who wants to work on hacking projects, please come for the check-in to find out what's going on.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
