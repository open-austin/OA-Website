<p>This morning, KXAN ran a story about <a title="Bike Buddy website" href="http://bike-buddy.open-austin.org/">Bike Buddy</a>, a new website we created as part of May Bike Month. The site helps new bike commuters find an experienced buddy to help them.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Austin city leaders and bike advocacy groups have come up with a way to help timid cyclists gain confidence to ride to work.</p>
<p>“So you can meet your perfect match. Somebody who’s going the same route that you are can help advise you on what route works the best, what equipment to use and how to follow the rules of the road,” said Councilman Chris Riley.
