<p><strong>Topic:</strong> ATX Hack for Change</p>
<p>The second annual <a href="http://atxhackforchange.org/">ATX Hack for Change</a> is happening this month (May 31 - Jun 1). Once again, Open Austin is co-presenting the event. Claire Dunn, from St. Edward's University, will be our guest, to talk about the event and plans for this year.</p>
<p>We are inviting potential project champions to come and give us "mock pitches" of their project ideas. We will provide feedback and suggestions, to help them refine their project proposals. We'll also have an opportunity to discuss civic project ideas we may want to see brought to the event.</p>
<p>Please join us if you want to help shape the hack projects at the event -- or if you have an idea that you might like to bring forward to the event.</p>
<p>After the meetup, we'll move across the street to Cenote cafe.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking. If you park, however, be sure to move your car if you plan to come to Cenote. The lot is locked when the library closes.</p>
<p>The Open Austin Hack Team will have a check-in from 6:00 - 6:30 pm, in advance of the meetup. If you are a developer or designer who wants to work on hacking projects, please come for the check-in to find out what's going on.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
