<strong>Time:</strong> 6:45 - 8:45 pm<br />

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Open Austin / Advancing Open Gov &amp; Open Data 2015</p>
<p>We will not have a guest speaker this month. Instead, we'll use the December meetup to identify our key objectives for bringing more open data and technology to the City of Austin in 2015.</p>
<p>We'll have a facilitated discussion how we should focus on for our policy and hacking efforts in 2015. There is an immense opportunity before us to push open data and open government to the next level. We want your input -- and involvement -- to help make that happen.</p>
<p>The meetup location is easily accessed by public transportation and has plentiful parking.</p>
<p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues. Our meet-ups are free and open to the public.</p>
