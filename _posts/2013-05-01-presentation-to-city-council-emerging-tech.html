<p>This week, we were invited to give a presentation to the Austin City Council <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/emerging-technology-and-telecommunications-committee">Emerging Technology and Telecommunications Committee</a>. Open Austin members Chip Rosenthal and Herb Watkins presented.</p>
<p>Herb reported on our success in initiating regular <a href="http://atxhack.wikispaces.com/Getting+Started">Open Government Hack Nights</a>, and the happy achievement that a core group has emerged that is making constant progress on hack projects. He also summarized the three current projects, being worked on actively.</p>
<p>Chip reported on upcoming events: the upcoming May 23 Civic Tech Expo and the June 1-2 <a href="http://hackforchange.org/atx-hackathon-change-2013">National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon</a>. Switching gears from hacking to government issues, Chip also reviewed the status with the Office of Civic Technology Innovation proposal. He discussed the need for more public engagement in the process, and impacts of the delays.</p>
