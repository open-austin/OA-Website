<p>Yesterday, Open Austin hosted a <a href="http://www.open-austin.org/article/315">Civic Hacking Meetup</a> at SXSW Create, a free "maker" event associated with SXSW. The event, in the outdoors Create pavilion  was a little touch and go due to the weather (pro tip: I tell the out of towners we like the rain and wind because it keeps down the scorpions), but it worked out great (minus one sound board that got toppled in a gust of wind). About 25 people participated.</p>
<p>We had a panel discussion, with interactive questions and feedback from the audience.</p>
<p>Panelists were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Chip Rosenthal, Open Austin</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Matt Esquibel, City of Austin</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Abhi Nemani, Code for America</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Jase Wilson, neighbor.ly</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Matthew Marcus, Kansas City Startup Village</span></li>
</ul>
<p>At the start of the session, moderator Chip Rosenthal polled attendees to find they were split about 1/3 from Austin, 2/3 from out of town. All were active with civic hacking or app development. All were involved with a local organization to support civic hacking.</p>
<p>The questions the audience wanted the panel to address were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about things people were doing or working on, with project specifics.</li>
<li>What else is happening at SXSW with regard to civic hacking?</li>
<li>What are some of the best practices and lessons learned?</li>
<li>What are the differences in interests between NGOs and government when it comes to civic hacking -- and what is the intersection?</li>
<li>Where does the private (commercial) sector fit in?</li>
<li>What are some of the platforms and standards that are important to civic hackers, such as Open311?</li>
</ul>
<p>That night, the San Antonio Express-News ran a story that summarized the session. Read it here: <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Hacking-for-the-civic-good-at-SXSW-4340768.php">Hacking for the civic good at SXSW</a>.</p>
