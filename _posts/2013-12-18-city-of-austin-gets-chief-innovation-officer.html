<p>Our two-year effort to support a new Office of Civic Innovation within the City of Austin has culminated with the appointment of the first Chief Innovation Officer for the City.</p>
<p>Last night, the City announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>City Manager Marc Ott announced today, Dec. 17, that he was appointing Kerry O'Connor to become the first Chief Innovation Officer to the City of Austin.</p>
<p>"I expect the Innovation Office to work across City departments, as well as forge relationships between the City, university, community, businesses, and the technology community and to serve as a gateway for proactively engaging diverse constituencies in creating unique and creative solutions to civic challenges," said Austin City Manager Marc Ott.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. O'Connor is scheduled to start March 24, 2014.</p>
<p>We see this position as key for moving forward on the open government and open data policies established by the Mayor and City Council.</p>
