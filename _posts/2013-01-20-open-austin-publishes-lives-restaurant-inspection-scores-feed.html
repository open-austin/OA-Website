<p>On Thursday morning, January 17, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> announced a new data standard called "<a href="http://foodinspectiondata.us/">Local Inspector Value-entry Specification</a>" (or LIVES) for reporting restaurant inspection scores. (See the announcement <a href="http://officialblog.yelp.com/2013/01/introducing-lives.html">here</a>.) This standard would allow services such as Yelp to include this valuable data when presenting restaurant information.</p>
<p>About 48 hours later, on Saturday, January 19, Open Austin started publishing a LIVES data feed for Austin, TX.</p>
<p>We'd like to claim it was mad coding skills that allowed us to erect this data feed in record time. Truth is, this is the awesome power of open government data.</p>
<p>The City of Austin already was publishing restaurant inspection scores on the city data portal. You can find that information here: <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Restaurant-Inspection-Scores/ecmv-9xxi">https://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Restaurant-Inspection-Scores/ecmv-9xxi</a></p>
<p>It took just a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon to convert the existing data into LIVES format.</p>
<p>The data feed is published here: <a href="http://data.open-austin.org/lives.ci.austin.tx.us.zip">http://data.open-austin.org/lives.ci.austin.tx.us.zip</a></p>
<p>The data converter has been published as open source here: <a href="https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/atx-lives-feed">https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/atx-lives-feed</a></p>
<p>We have contacted both the City of Austin and Yelp about the feed. We'll let you know if there is any news.</p>
<p><strong>Jan 24 update:</strong> Both the City of Austin and Yelp have responded with interest. We're hoping that Yelp will pick up the Austin feed, once they are done integrating their current data sources.</p>
