<p><a href="http://atxdataportal.wikispaces.com/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-953" src="/assets/screenshot-data-portal-howto-300x273.png" alt="screenshot-data-portal-howto" width="300" height="273" /></a>You may know that the City of Austin runs an <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/">open data portal</a>, with more than 200 unique open government datasets.</p>
<p>The data portal, however, is much more than a mere file repository. It offers features that allow you to search, sort, roll-up, and graph the data. If the dataset has addresses, you can even generate maps of the data.</p>
<p>It's a lot of capability -- but people don't always know it's there. It would be great if we had a tool that helped explain how to use these features of the data portal.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://atxhackforchange.org/">ATX Hack for Change</a> hackathon this past June, a team of volunteers developed a website to help people use some of the tools provided on the data portal. A hackathon prototype is great, but moving that to a released product is always a challenge.</p>
<p>So, we're pleased  to announce their website is now available for use. Check it out:</p>

<p>Thanks to Juliette Kernion, Alane Fitzgerald, Chris McConnell, Marbenn Cayetano, Tim. and Gail Maynard for developing this resource and making it available to the community.</p>
