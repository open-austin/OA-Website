<p>Last week, two locally-supported civic applications were submitted to the <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The Knight News Challenge accelerates media innovation by funding breakthrough ideas in news and information. The challenge topic is, "How might we improve the way citizens and governments interact.?" Winners receive a share of $5 million in funding and support from Knightâ€™s network of influential peers and advisors to help advance their ideas.</p>
<p>Our members submitted two proposals, for applications that were conceived at local civic hackathons, and continue to be developed by the community at our bi-weekly hack nights. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/recycling-pickup-app-a-platform-for-mobile-civic-service-location/">Recycling Pickup App</a>: A Platform for Mobile Civic Service Location</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/tec-filer-campaign-finance-database-for-texas-municipalities/">TEC Filer</a>: Campaign Finance Database for Texas Municipalities</li>
</ul>
<p>These projects are among 837 entries from around the globe, collected during the "Submission" phase of the program. We currently are in a "Feedback" phase, which runs through March 29. After that, semi-finalists will be designated, who will have a chance to refine their proposals for final selection.</p>
<p>The Knight Foundation invites the public to participate. You can give "applause" to projects you like. Also, you can make comments or ask questions about the projects. (<a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/signup.html">Registration required</a>.)</p>
<p>You can help support our local civic apps. Between now and March 29, visit the project pages, give applause,and leave feedback.</p>
